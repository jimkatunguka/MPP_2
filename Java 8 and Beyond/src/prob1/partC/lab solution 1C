A HashMap uses the hashcode value of an object to 
find out how the object would be stored in the collection.

if objects are equal according to the equals method, 
then calling the hashcode method on each of them must 
produce the same result.

The Haschcode was not overriden yet a hashmap is being used
to remove duplicates.
